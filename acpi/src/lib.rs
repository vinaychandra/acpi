//! A library for parsing ACPI tables. This crate can be used by bootloaders and kernels for
//! architectures that support ACPI. The crate is far from feature-complete, but can still be used
//! for finding and parsing the static tables, which is enough to set up hardware such as the APIC
//! and HPET on x86_64.
//!
//! The crate is designed for use in conjunction with the `aml` crate, which is the (much
//! less complete) AML parser used to parse the DSDT and SSDTs. These crates are separate because
//! some kernels may want to detect the static tables, but delay AML parsing to a later stage.
//!
//! ### Usage
//! To use the library, you will need to provide an implementation of the `AcpiHandler` trait,
//! which allows the library to make requests such as mapping a particular region of physical
//! memory into the virtual address space.
//!
//! You should then call one of the entry points, based on how much information you have:
//! * Call `parse_rsdp` if you have the physical address of the RSDP
//! * Call `parse_rsdt` if you have the physical address of the RSDT / XSDT
//! * Call `search_for_rsdp_bios` if you don't have the address of either structure, but **you know
//! you're running on BIOS, not UEFI**
//!
//! All of these methods return an instance of `Acpi`. This struct contains all the information
//! gathered from the static tables, and can be queried to set up hardware etc.
